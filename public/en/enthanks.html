        <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
        <p>
            <br>This portfolio, has been a long yearning that has finally become a reality. Thanks to the learning acquired through various video tutorials and chatGPT prompts based on artificial intelligence about portfolios, HTML, CSS and JS.</br>

            <br>In particular, I recognize, value and thank the work and dedication of the original developers and their video tutorials for their structural examples. These examples helped me as a base to adapt them to my professional information.</br>

            <br>In addition, I have spent time reading about color theory in CSS, image management in Photoshop, fonts, and I have read extensively about page layout, based on examples.</br>

            <br>This learning process has given me the ability to customize my site, incorporating personal elements such as the logo, tagline, color gradient adjustments, avoiding saturation in the page display, a language switching element, a button to switch between light and dark modes, font style and gradient, and a little bit of development. Finally, the adaptation for viewing on mobile devices, adjusting my professional information in the best way I could.</br>

            <br>I hope this little project and the information it contains, is of your interest and I express my sincere gratitude for the time you have spent reading this humble note.</br>
